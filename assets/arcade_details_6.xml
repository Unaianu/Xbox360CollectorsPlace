This this six-episode game series begins with events towards the end of Season Three of the TV show, and ends right before the beginning of Season Five.

Built over fifteen hundred years ago by Cedric Forrester and his triplet sons, Ironrath is a testament to the strength and endurance of Ironwood.

Chivalry: Medieval Warfare combines a sharp melee edge and familiar competitive gameplay along with the genuine look and feel of open-field combat in the Middle Ages. Players can choose between one of four classes - Knight, Vanguard, Man-at-Arms and Archer - each balanced to offer a unique set of strengths and vulnerabilities in any given situation. An extensive armory of more than sixty period-authentic weapons, including swords, shields, daggers, maces, axes, javelins, longbows and crossbows, delivers deadly choices for decimating foes.<br><br>Melee combat in Chivalry: Medieval Warfare is more than just hack and slash. Players will use different attacks, blocks and counters insuring that combat is tactical, responsive and of course chaotic. Prepare to fight in a variety of inspired medieval environments and scenarios. Raid peasant villages, burn crops, siege castles, defend the royal family, or fight to the last man in a gladiatorial arena. Multiple modes provide opportunities to fight as a team for the greater glory of the realm, or for personal honor in duels to the death.",

Xbox360CollectorsPlace
======================

Android App to organize your Xbox 360 game collection and browse its entire catalog offline.

In order for this project to work, appcompat library is required to be imported as a project library. Google play License Library,
Google Play Expansion Zip Library, and Google Play Downloader Library will be asked to be added to, but they are no longer needed,,
as the App is no longer in Google Play, so it's best to remove all the classes inside bl/extension to avoid the errors.

and is multilanguage (although only English, Spanish and Basque are translated without using Google Translate).
